# Party-Animals

Party Animals is a multiplayer party game platform where you can invite your friends and play games quickly and easily.

## How does it work

One player creates a party of which they then become the party host. Other players can then join using a party link* or code or by joining a random public party*. Players in the party must then vote for a game that they would like to play*. Some games require teams to be made at the start of the game*. The winner(s) of a game gain 1 point at the end of each game and the player with the most score becomes the party king*.

## Features (note: most features are not implemented yet)
- A party: a group of players that play games together, can either be private or public.
- Party host: leader of the party, is required to run a party and play games, when they leave a new player will become the party host and if the party is currently playing a game said game will end. The party host can kick and promote players.
- Party king: best performing player of the party.
- Teams: some games require teams, teams are made when a game that requires teams starts and end as soon as the game ends. Every player in the winning team gains a point at the end of a game.
